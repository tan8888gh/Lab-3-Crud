4. Setup the `.env` file, e.g. based on `.env.example`

5. To run the application use

## Introduction

In this lab you will use products data from [dummyjson.com](https://dummyjson.com/products?limit=40&skip=0&select=id,title,description,category,price,rating,stock,brand,sku,thumbnail) to build a web application to manage products. You will add the **CRUD** functions used previous labs to allow users to **c**reate, **r**ead, **u**pdate, and **d**elete products.

After starting the application you should see a new entry, **Products** in the navigation menu which does not work yet - following the link displays an error.

In the **`app`** folder you will find the following:

1. a model class for **`Product`**.

2. **`data access`**  functions, including `dataInitDB()` which populates `products_data` from dummy json when `dataGetProducts()` is accessed for the first time after startup.

3. **`product_service`** functions.

4. **`view_template/product`** contains the product page template.
5. Also see `.env_example` for the dummyjson URL.

## Exercises

1. Add a **route** to handle requests for `/product` by returning the appropriate HTML response.

2. **Display** the full list  of products  in the product page. Use appropriate HTML elements with Bootstrap 5.3 styling. For examples Bootstrap 'cards' or a **Table**. Include the thumbnail images in your page.

   ![product table](assets/product_table.png)

3. **Add new products** via a form (use  a URL link for the thumbnail image).
4. Implement features to **update** and **delete** products when their edit/ delete buttons are clicked.
